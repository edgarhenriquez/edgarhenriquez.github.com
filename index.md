Hi, my name is Edgar Henríquez.

I'm a programmer from Venezuela, now living in Miami and working at MDLIVE.

I got a Computer Engineering degree from Simón Bolívar University, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics.

Programming aside, I like reading, mountain biking, making photos, playing videogames, and visiting new places.
